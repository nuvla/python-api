# Nuvla Python Client Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nuvla/python-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nuvla/python-library)

Nuvla client library to facilitate interaction with the Nuvla REST API
via the Python language.

## Artifacts

 - `nuvla-api` package: Available from
   [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/nuvla-api/).


## Documentation
You can get the full documentation by typing:

```python
from nuvla.api import Api
help(Api)
```

Or for a specific function:

```python
from nuvla.api import Api
help(Api.search)
```

## Usage

```python
  from nuvla.api import Api
  
  api = Api('https://nuvla.io')
  
  # Login with username & password
  api.login_password('username', 'password')
  # or
  # Login with api-key & secret
  api.login_apikey('credential/uuid', 'secret')

  api.search('user')

  # Logout
  api.logout()
  ```
## Release Process

Configure `~/.pypirc` with pypi repo credentials. This file should look
like as following:

```
[distutils]
index-servers=pypi

[pypi]
username = <username>
password = <password>
```

**Before** creating the release:

 - Decide what semantic version to use for this release and change the
   version, if necessary, in `code/project.clj` and all the `pom.xml`
   files.  (It should still have the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix.)

 - Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

 - Push all changes to GitHub, including the updates to
   `CHANGELOG.md`.

Again, be sure to set the version **before** tagging the release.

Check that everything builds correctly with:

    mvn clean install

To tag the code with the release version and to update the master
branch to the next snapshot version, run the command:

    ./release.sh true

If you want to test what will happen with the release, leave off the
"true" argument and the changes will only be made locally.
